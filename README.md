# ATCSimulatation4Testing
**ATC simulation**

In this work, we implemented the simulation of aircraft landing operation using JADE framewok. The implementation shows the interaction of aircraft or flight desk (FD) system, surveillance data processing system (SDP), and short term alert notification system (STCA).

**PAT-based cyberattack-driven test case generation** 

A model checking approach for test case generation is not a new idea (cite). We want to use this approach for focused test case generation i.e. a test case designed for specific property of the system based on known (putative) cyberattacks. For this purpose, we model putative cyberattacker behaviour as one component of the sysem under consideration. This opens an opportunity to analyze the vulnerablity of the system.
